# PyCVision
PyCVision is a Python-based real-time object detection system powered by the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) algorithm.
This project leverages the efficiency and accuracy of YOLOv3 for detecting and classifying multiple objects in live video streams or static images.

# Builds And Download
It's so simple, At first you need to have python installed, after that start with installing necessary requirements, type:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

now download YOLOv3 which is needed in this project:
[`YOLOv3.weights`](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights)
[`YOLOv3.cfg`](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/raw/refs/heads/master/cfg/yolov3.cfg)
[`coco.names`](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet/raw/refs/heads/master/data/coco.names)
put all three downloaded files into the same directory where main.py is

then try to run project with following command:

    py main.py

**Tested On `Python 3.12.8`**
